# Social-Network-API
This is a demo test for functionality behind a social media software. Features of this software would include a User database with emails and usernames, posts called "Thoughts" (like tweets), and replies to those thoughts called Reactions. There is also a friend list functionality.

This runs through all the CRUD API calls you would need to connect to a front end.

languages are all Javascript and Node, with libraries Mongoose, MongoDB, and express.
